Engineered a dynamic To-Do List application leveraging Swift and SwiftData to implement robust data persistence, enabling real-time creation, modification, and deletion of user-generated task entries. Utilized declarative data modeling and state management to handle user input while integrating Core Data-backed storage through SwiftDataâ€™s schema and container architecture. Although still under active development, the project showcases foundational CRUD operations, view-binding using SwiftUI, and the integration of data-driven UI updates in response to state changes.
